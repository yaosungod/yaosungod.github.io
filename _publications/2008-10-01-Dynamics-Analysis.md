In this paper, a dynamical six-degrees-of-freedom biomechanical mathematical model of the human masticatory system was developed. The model incorporated morphology, physiological properties, muscle architecture and dynamical muscle properties. The movements of the human jaw are controlled by the forces produced by the masticatory muscles, whereas passive structures such as ligaments and joint surfaces are considered to be limiting factors. The mechanical stimulations of the jaw movement were built up. We use Runge-Kutta method to resolve second-order ordinary different equation of the jaw-opening movement. Various symmetrical jaw-opening and jaw-closing movements were simulated based upon different muscle forces and jaw-opening muscles schemes. The amount of jaw opening was limited by the passive forces of the jaw-closing muscles.
